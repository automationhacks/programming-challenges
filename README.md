# Welcome to programming challenges 👨🏻‍💻👩🏻‍💻

Yes, Like everyone else, I also got curious about the modern coding interview phenomenon. This
repository contains coding interview problems, and their solutions found from multiple different
sites. Mostly in Python, some in Kotlin/Java as well. I've followed a maven folder structure. Feel
free to browse.

## How to add a problem or solution

- Add the problem statement within a block comment while giving idea of the difficulty and what
  topic the problem tests on

```text
In case of python

"""
Source: Leetcode
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/
Topic: Data structures (Deque, Circular queue)

<Your problem statement here>
"""

For Java/Kotlin
/**

Source: Leetcode
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/
Topic: Data structures (Deque, Circular queue)
*/
```

Follow this by your method and provide its average and worst-case time and space complexity analysis
(Big O analysis), optionally explain the approach for later reference. (Please use good variable names! 🙏🏼)
