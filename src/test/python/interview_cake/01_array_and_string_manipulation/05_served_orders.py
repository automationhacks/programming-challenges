My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating 
experience.

I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the 
customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. 
Yikes—that's not good for business!

To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

    The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (take_out_orders)
    The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dine_in_orders)
    Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (served_orders)

Given all three lists, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out 
in the same order customers requested it.

We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

As an example,

  Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
 Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
  Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]

would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.

But,

  Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
 Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
  Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]

would be first-come, first-served.

Note: Order numbers are arbitrary. They do not have to be in increasing order.

 O(n) time and O(1) additional space. 
 We walk through served_orders, seeing if each customer order so far matches a customer order from one of the two 
 registers. To check this, we:

    Keep pointers to the current index in take_out_orders, dine_in_orders, and served_orders.
    Walk through served_orders from beginning to end.
    If the current order in served_orders is the same as the current customer order in take_out_orders, increment 
    take_out_orders_index and keep going. This can be thought of as "checking off" the current customer order in 
    take_out_orders and served_orders, reducing the problem to the remaining customer orders in the lists.
    Same as above with dine_in_orders.
    If the current order isn't the same as the customer order at the front of take_out_orders or dine_in_orders, 
    we know something's gone wrong and we're not serving food first-come, first-served.
    If we make it all the way to the end of served_orders, we'll check that we've reached the end of take_out_orders 
    and dine_in_orders. If every customer order checks out, that means we're serving food first-come, first-served.
